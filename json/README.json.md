# JSON - JavaScript Object Notation - examples  
### Sam Mazarei  
We need a format to transfer data from the front end user to the rest of the app architecture. These .json files are what the front end will be creating, populating with relevant data, and then uploading to the S3 bucket.  
In python, the json module allows you to read/write and wrangle json objects in a way much like python dictionaries.  
This README will be updated soon to explain the .json examples and include examples of how to create/read json with python 3.
