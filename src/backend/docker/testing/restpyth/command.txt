# Example docker run command that will run a python:3 container and execute 'python --version'

docker run -it --rm --name="my-hello-world" -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp python:3 python --version
<docker run> runs a command in a new container
< -it > allows for an interactive terminal
< --rm > deletes the container once it completes its task
< --name="my-hello-world" > assign name my-hello-world to container
< -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp[:OPTIONS]> creates a bind mount. bind mounts $PWD (the bash shells present working directory) in host to /usr/src/myapp in the Docker container. Adding options (look in man under -v and --volumes-from ) to set rw and ro etc options on volumes, can ount volumes between containers.... figure it out
< -w /usr/src/myapp> sets the containers working directory to /usr/src/myapp
< Python:3 > this is the docker image to load. If it isn't loaded it will load it. Figure out how to insert path to custom restricted python image
< python > this is the command to run on the new container once it is up
< --version > this is an argument passed to the command
