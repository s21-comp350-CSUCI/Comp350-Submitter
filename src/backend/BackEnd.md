# How the back end works _v 1.0_   
Authored by Sam Mazarei  
### Before the backend runs, a student submission is generated...  
When a student submission is generated, two objects will bu uploaded to the
submitter S3 bucket. One is a single .py file provided by the student(s),
and a .json file generated by the front end logic containing all the requsit data for the backend to begin processing the submission.  
This json file will contain the following:
* submissionid  : a 128 bit MD5 Hash unique to the specific students, admin, event,  and problem.
* admin         : The admin's unique identifier (e.g "m.soltys").  
* event         : A string identifier that is unique to the admin.
* problem       : A string identifier unique to the event.
* tokens        : A(n) list/array of tokens generated by the front end upon event registration.  

An example:  
[submission_example.json](./json/submission_example.json)
```
{
  "subid": "fc55c0190dde2bc413d8d1e79fb8cca2",
  "admin": "m.soltys",
  "event": "aws labs",
  "problem": "lab 5 - containers",
  "tokens": [
    "d823640ab3b0f7a4a2bc9fc89661e940",
    "240669d4326dea48bba75e066b90b76f",
    "4b31d568d86a9350d746c7c2fe9bf5c8"
  ]
}        
```  

A new object in the submitter S3 bucket triggers a lambda function written in python. This lambda function will analyse 
the name of the new object, and if the new object is a student submission json file, it generates a message and sends it 
to the submitter SQS queue. This message is a json file and contains just one key : value pair as of this writing:
```
{
  "subdata" : "fc55c0190dde2bc413d8d1e79fb8cca2.json"
}        
```
